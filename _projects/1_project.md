<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Abstract </h1>
    
  <p>Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. </p>
  <p>Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is          variable.</p>
    
    <p> I build the Conventional Neural netowrk model in such a way that it detect the Pneumonia status of a patient without blood test,oximeter test and           other. </p>

     <p> The model takes a chest X-ray as an input and searched for any signs of pneumonia such as white spots in the lungs (called infiltrates) that     
         identify an infection. </p>

    <p> This exam will also help determine if you have any complications related to pneumonia such as abscesses or pleural effusions. </p>
