<h1> Abstract </h1>

- Securing data against cyber threats is critical in
today's digital landscape. Because of improved URL shorteners
and algorithms, traditional blacklists for detecting malicious
URLs are becoming ineffective.

- Our suggested approach makes
use of machine learning to improve the detection of malicious
URLS and web content.

- Our solution effectively identifies and
flags both new and existing digital risks using ensemble learning,
ensuring robust web security without reliance on databases. This
simplified approach represents a significant advancement in the
protection of sensitive information in the cyber environment.
