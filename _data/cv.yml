    - title: Insurance cost prediction
      year: sep 2020
      description: Four of the ML algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multiple Regression, XGBoost are used to build 4 models to predict insurance cost.The model which had better accuracy will be chosen for tax prediction.
      
    - title: Detection of malicious URL using Ensemble Learning 
      year: September 2023
      description: The project is primarily focused on identifying pneumonia without the need for additional tests by using a Chest X-Ray as an input. 
                  - Greyscale Normalization is one of the algorithms used
                  - to scale up the data, as is Data. The Chex NET algorithm is utilized for training the CNN model, and the back
                  - propagation approach is used for fitting the model over 12 epochs.

    - title: Crop yeild prediction
      year: june 2021- aug 2021
      description: Developed a model which helps to predict about when, where and at which time required to seed a crop that helps farmers to get better yeild. 
    
    - title: Medical ChatBot using Python
      year: 2021-2022
      description: Aim is to take symptoms as input from user and predict what type of disease does user have
                   Sequential model is used to extract the symptoms from the text given by user 
                   KNN algorithm is used for predicting the type of disease
                   It also recommends the doctor in that field
                   
    - title: AI Enabled legal Assistance System
      year: 2021-2022
      description: Given a case, finding the related prior cases and their judgements is a time consuming job of a lawyer.
                   The work here is to present a case study to retrieve judgements given in the past for a good factual description.
                   LDA is used for topic modelling and for improved precision

      
    - title: Smart Health Monitoring (SHM)
      year: nov 2021
      description: A web app for monitoring all your vitals in real time with fall detection and automatic gps tracking and SOS, implemented using Django and IoT. <br> My team was the runner ups in the inter-departmental hackathon.

    - title: Pneumonia Disease Detection using CNN
      year: 2021-2022
      description: The Conventional Neural network model in such a way that it detect the Pneumonia status of a patient without blood test,oximeter test and other.
                   The model incorporates a chest x Ray as input and looks for signs of pneumonia, including such white spots inside the lungs (known as interstitium), that suggest an infection.
                    We created the Conventional Neural Network model in such a way that it can detect a patient's Pneumonia condition without using blood tests, oximeter tests, or other methods
